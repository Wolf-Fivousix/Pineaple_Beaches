# [Pineapple Beaches](https://pineapple-beaches.herokuapp.com/)

Pineapple Beaches is a website where users can interact with posts and beaches to understand more information about local or travel locations which involve beaches. This project uses **MongoDb, Express, React, Redux, and Node.JS** for the framework.

This project was built and designed within a 5 day period by a team of three. We do plan on adding more to the project over time.
